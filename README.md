## TRAVEL BUCKET LIST

#### BRIEF:
I am building an app to be able to track destinations that I have visited and would like to visit! Also, where other people would be able to add to it to include their destinations.

#### MVP:
- A user should be able to view destinations that have been visited.
- A user should be able to view destinations that are on people bucket list that they would like to visit.
- A user should be able to add a destination to either the visited list or to visit list.

#### EXTENSIONS:
- A user should be able to expand details of a destination to then be able to add or edit it.
The app should include css.
- A user should be able to view all destinations

#### ADVANCED EXTENSIONS:
- A user should be able to search a destination and it return details of it.
- A user should be able to filter the list of destinations to show what they are looking for.
