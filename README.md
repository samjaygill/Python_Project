## TRAVEL BUCKET LIST

#### BRIEF:
I am building an app to be able to track destinations that I have visited and would like to visit! Also, where other people would be able to add to it to include their destinations.

#### MVP:
- A user should be able to enter the website.
- A user should be able to view all destinations.
- A user should be able to add a destination.

#### EXTENSIONS:
- A user should be able to expand details of a destination to then be able delete it.
- A user should be able to update a destination that hasnt been visited.
- The app should include css.

#### ADVANCED EXTENSIONS:
- A user should be able to search a destination and it returns the details of it.

#### SETUP:

- createdb travel_manager
- psql -d travel_manager -f db/travel_manager.sql
- python3 console.py
